## Getting Started

*IMPORTANT:* Place your license key in `~/.luther-license.yaml`.

Ensure you have the build dependencies. On MacOS you can use the commands:

```
brew install make git go wget
brew install --cask docker
```

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/luthersystems/sandbox.git
```

Run `make` to build all the services:
```
make
```

See the [docs](https://docs.luthersystems.com/luther/application/start) for more details.

## Directory Structure

Overview of the directory structure

```
sandbox_compose.py:
	Helper script to launch containers for testing. Called indirectly by
	Make targets.
build:
	Temporary build artifacts (do not check into git).
common.mk:
	Common variables and utilities for Make across the project.
common.godynamic.mk:
	Common variables for building Go project across the project.
common.fabric.mk:
    Common variables for running fabric networks
api/:
	API specification and artifacts. See README.
compose/:
	Configuration for docker compose networks that are brought up during
	testing. These configurations are used by the existing Make targets
	and `sandbox_compose.py`.
	common.yaml:
		Common network configuration that is imported into all other
		compose configurations.
	local.yaml:
		Configuration for a local fabric network.
	mem.yaml:
		Configuration for an "in-memory" mode fabric network.
	setenv.d/:
		Common scripts for setting env variables for compose.
fabric/:
	Configuration and scripts to launch a fabric network locally.
go.sum:
	Version hashes for dependent Go libraries.
go.mod:
	Pinned dependencies for vendored Go libraries (go mod tool).
Makefile:
	Project-wide build targets, including running various tests and pushing
	release artifacts.
oracleserv/sandbox-oracle/:
	The oracle service (Go) responsible for serving the REST/JSON APIs and
	communicating with other microservices.
phylum/:
	Business logic (ELPS [0]) that is executed "on-chain" using the platform
	(substrate).
scripts/:
	Helper scripts for the build process.
tests/:
	End-to-end API tests that use martin.
.gitignore:
	File patterns to identify files & directories that should not be
	checked into Git.
```

### Phylum: Chaincode Business Logic

Phylum code can be found in `phylum/`. Typically each sub domain is
encapsulated in its own file.

## Getting started

## Testing

> You can view our testing guidelines here: [Testing guidelines](./docs/testing-guidelines.md)

Features and bug fixes should include a test to demonstrate that the changed
or new functionality works as intended. This may be reviewed as part of the
acceptance review.

There are 3 main ways to write tests in this project:

1) E2E tests using the `martin` tool, which are stored under the `tests/` dir
   with filenames like `X.martin_collection.yaml`. These tests exercise end-
   to-end functionality of the oracle REST/JSON APIs using the `postman` tool.
   This kind of test is most appropriate in demonstrating a happy path for a
   story, and not edge-case or unit testing. These tests also form documentation
   used by the frontend team to see how a new feature works. New tests should
   live under a directory describing the general entity APIs that are tested,
   e.g, a test that exercises the documents API should live under
   `tests/documents`.

2) Go [integration] tests, many of which live in: `oracleserv/sandbox-oracle/oracle/X_test.go`.
   These tests are closer to integration tests, and test e2e connectivity of the
   chaincode (phylum) layer. This is an appropriate place for edge-case testing,
   and complex logic testing. These tests run a mock blockchain ("in-memory"
   mode).

3) ELPS [unit] tests, which live in: `phylum/*_test.lisp`. This an appropriate place
   to unit test ELPS logic. Presently it mainly includes unit tests for utility
   functions which otherwise wouldn't be tested in the Go tests and data
   migrations.

### Running E2E [Martin] Tests

For e2e testing, you can launch the oracles and run fabric in several modes,
described below.

1) in-memory mode: Emulates fabric directly within the oracle process, this is
   a light-weight and fast way of running tests and does not require launching
   the entire fabric network.

   To launch an "in-memory" network run:
   ```
   make mem-up
   ```

2) local network: Launch a full fabric network locally. This is a heavier method,
   but more accurate/realistic way of testing.

   To launch the local network:
   ```
   make up
   ```

Do a `docker ps` to list which services are running. You can also use
`docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME` to dump the logs for that container. E.g.,

```
docker logs sandbox_oracle
```

Once the services are running you can kick off the e2e tests using the following
command from the project dir:

```
make integration
```

This will run all of the `martin` tests under the `tests/` directory using
the local docker configuration.

To run a specific test use `./test/run-postman-collections-docker.sh`:

```
./tests/run-postman-collections-docker.sh  ./tests/Docker.postman_environment.json ./tests/claim/APP-XXX-claim.martin_collection.yaml
```

The REST/JSON API is accessible from your localhost on port 8080. You can issue
CURL commands to spot test locally.

```
time curl -X GET -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"  --cookie "$COOKIE" -s http://localhost:8080/v1/health_check | jq ''
```

#### Debugging E2E tests

You can add additional console.logs in your tests to better see what's being
returned however some people find it very useful to proxy all the requests
to the oracle through a local proxy and watch the response and requests
directly.

You can find instructions for how this can be setup here:
[Setting up a proxy for martin tests](https://docs.luthersystems.com/luther/application/testing-guidelines/martin/proxy)

### Running Integration [Go] tests

Integration tests can be run via the Makefile using the following targets:

- `make oraclegotest` (all tests)

From the oracle directory run the following command to print the necessary
env variables for local Go tests:

```
make host-go-env
```

and ensure the outputted env variables are set in your shell.

The rest of the `go test` tool chain works as usual.

#### Running Go tests directly on a Darwin host

Specific test cases can be isolated using the helper script using `-run`, for example:

```
go test -timeout 30m -parallel 8 -v -run=AppXXX ./...
```

#### Running Go tests from your favorite editor

Make sure the env variables listed in the above step are set in your editor.

### Running Unit [ELPS] tests

`make phylumtest`
